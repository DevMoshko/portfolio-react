# Portfolio

This is my front end web developer portfolio built using React.

## Things I Learned

I certainly learned a lot of things while building out this portfolio. To name a few:

- Setting up contact form with Netlify
- Passing down styles as props
- Creating reusable UI components, not just whole sections
- Using the useState & useEffect hooks to load in and display data from a local JSON file
- Using all 3 arguments in .map() to display some data from local JSON file as desired
